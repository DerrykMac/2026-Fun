# 365 days of Repos

## Day 0 - Repository Initialization
If you are new here:
### This is a Repository where I will be trying to commit something every day for all of [This year] aka 2026.
Sometimes its code, sometimes its updating a file in the folders, sometimes its what happended in my life and sometimes its just a full blown rant. (I try keep thoes in [Rants.md](./Rants.md))
I also write topics in [FutureTopics.md](./FutureTopics.md) that I want to cover in the future. Do i get to them all? well by the fact that im taking my 2025 list over to 2026, No lol. But i'll do my best :D

Update on the repository: [Saving](/Saving/) folder will how have have the old stuff from preious years organized in subfolders. Because those are for helping others i want it to be easy to find.

Thats all for now, This was written 2025 so I'll write Day 1 when 2026 starts (Hopefully). <br>
Also dont expect much Day 1, I have no time New Years day lol.

## Day 1 - Happy New Year 2026!
I don't have much to say but happy new year.
