# 365 days of Repos

## Day 0 - Repository Initialization
If you are new here:
### This is a Repository where I will be trying to commit something every day for all of [This year] aka 2026.
Sometimes its code, sometimes its updating a file in the folders, sometimes its what happended in my life and sometimes its just a full blown rant. (I try keep thoes in [Rants.md](./Rants.md))
I also write topics in [FutureTopics.md](./FutureTopics.md) that I want to cover in the future. Do i get to them all? well by the fact that im taking my 2025 list over to 2026, No lol. But i'll do my best :D

Update on the repository: [Saving](/Saving/) folder will how have have the old stuff from preious years organized in subfolders. Because those are for helping others i want it to be easy to find.

Thats all for now, This was written 2025 so I'll write Day 1 when 2026 starts (Hopefully). <br>
Also dont expect much Day 1, I have no time New Years day lol.

## Day 1 - Happy New Year 2026!
I don't have much to say but happy new year. 

## Day 6 - I Live
I GOT SO SICK, WOW. I literally didnt have the strength to type on my computer, but we're back now. <br>
I want to kick things off from now before I derail so here's some IP facts for local networking:

An IP address is a string of numbers used to identify a device that is connected to a network. the address is used to bla bla bla, Computer uses numbers to find other computers basically. <br>
Imma only talk about IPv4 rn, because of simplicity and totally not because i have no clue how a IPv6 works :)

Heres an IP address `192.168.10.2` <br> 
Now why do i care about these numbers, its just binary slop right? Na mate you can read it too <br>

First part `192.168` that can tell you if the IP is private or public, most IPs are public (i mean if they wernt there wouldnt really be an internet now) but a select few are private
Private IP ranges are: `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16.x.x` to `172.31.x.x` <br>
what does private mean? well it means **THERE IN YOUR WALLS!!!**, na im serious, those private IPs are devices connected to the same network you are, its used by your router and your device to talk to each other. <br>
if the IP is public then it has to go through the router (But we'll talk about that another day) <br>
also, if its `127.x.x.x` then, IT WAS YOU BARRY, YOU ARE THE IP. Basically its your own computer, but nothing else can talk to it. <br>

Next part `.10.2` that tells you what device you are on ur network, typically a normal home network can only take 254 devices so the ips go from `192.168.0.1` to `192.168.0.255` and why would you ever need any more than 255 people on a wifi? well buisnesses do, my old work place had like 500 staff so they can get bigger plans from there ISP and get IPs like `192.168.1.1` to `192.168.5.255` which is like... 255 * 5 the amout of devices :D <br>

There's alot more IP stuff i could talk about, did you know that the Internet is complicated? ikr? crazy! <br>
But anywho i have 365 days to write so i'll save stuff for later.

Thanks for reading, and I hope your 2026 is going better than the americans.
